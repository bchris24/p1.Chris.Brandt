<p>Issues with the current design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Above-Board:&nbsp;While the current layout of the control panel is decent, the display for the floor level is located far above the control panel&mdash;and it wasn&rsquo;t working. There still are issues with the control panel design, but overall, it is within the bare minimum.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the design of the control panel&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple layout of three rows which contain the following types of buttons: emergency, floor level, and special function buttons.</li>
<li>All buttons light up when pressed.</li>
<li>The floor level buttons are logically placed and easily identifiable.</li>
<li>The emergency button directions are unclear.
<ul>
<li>What button should be pressed during an emergency?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The special function buttons are muddled with operator keyholes and label positioning.</li>
<li>Has no braille text or other accessibility features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong></p>
<p>Common use case:</p>
<p>As I am neither an elevator technician nor plan to become one, this interface is acceptable for my own use. I use elevators to travel between different floors of buildings, typically to transport heavy or bulky objects more easily and safely.</p>
<p>User use case:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user will call the elevator to their floor by pressing a button on the floor&rsquo;s control panel.</li>
<li>The user will enter the elevator when it arrives.</li>
<li>The user will find the button for the floor they wish to travel to on the elevator&rsquo;s interface.</li>
<li>The elevator will close its doors, transport the user to the corresponding floor, and will open its doors when it arrives.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the elevator support the user and provide feedback?</p>
<ul>
<li>The elevator buttons are placed in a logical layout, each button has a label to the left of it, and the buttons light up when they are pressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are some common mistakes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Overcomplicating the layout. As there are not many floors&mdash;and there is only one elevator door&mdash;the elevator does not need many features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Design improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the layout from &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; to &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Separate operator/technician functions to its own section.</li>
<li>Provide clearer instructions for the emergency buttons.</li>
<li>Provide additional accessibility options, like braille.</li>
<li>Provide short button functionality label for special buttons (like clear floor queue).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>The screen size will be 6x4 inches.</p>
